Mixed `harness_control` + Solidity changed-file sets are legal. The gate reports phase fields for `harness_writer_roles`, `code_writer_roles`, and `code_review_roles`.

For `prod-semantic` changes the gate additionally emits `doc_round_required` (and fills `harness_writer_roles` with `process-implementer`) so the main session runs the product-doc round before any code writer; the gate does not compute `affected_docs`.

For `prod-semantic` work, classification precedes dispatch. The main session dispatches each phase from those emitted fields.
