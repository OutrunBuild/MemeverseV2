/**
 * @title GenesisCreditFactory
 * @notice Owner-gated factory that deploys GenesisCredit tokens via CREATE3.
 * @dev Each credit token is keyed by its `uAsset`: the CREATE3 salt is `keccak256(abi.encode(uAsset))`
 *      and the factory self-inlines solmate `CREATE3.deploy`, so the CREATE3 namespace is the
 *      factory's own address (the deployer is `address(this)`). Each credit address is therefore
 *      `CREATE3.getDeployed(factory, keccak256(uAsset))` and is fully determined by the factory
 *      address plus `uAsset`. Because GenesisCredit is a plain (non-initializable) OFT, the full
 *      contract bytecode is deployed in one CREATE3 call and its constructor runs in-line; no
 *      separate implementation provisioning or initialize step is needed.
 *
 *      Ownership: this factory is OZ `Ownable` (non-upgradeable) and gates `deployCredit` behind
 *      `onlyOwner`. There is no separate deployer contract to own, so no ownership transfer is
 *      required before first deployment.
