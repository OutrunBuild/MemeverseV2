 * @title GenesisCredit
 * @notice Home-chain-only merkle-airdrop credit token (ERC-20 + LayerZero OFT).
 * @dev Plain (non-upgradeable) contract inheriting the official LayerZero OFT. Claiming mints
 *      new supply and is gated to the configured home chain eid so that remote-chain OFT
 *      deployments can bridge tokens but never mint via claims. Ownership and the LayerZero
 *      delegate come from OFTCore's plain OZ Ownable; the `_delegate` constructor argument is
 *      set as owner, so `onlyOwner` gates `setMerkleRoot` with no extra access-control wiring.
